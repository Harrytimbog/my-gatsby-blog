Wolves are complex, **highly intelligent** animals who are caring, playful, and above all devoted to family. Only a select few other species exhibit these traits so clearly. Just like elephants, gorillas and dolphins, wolves educate their young, take care of their injured and live in family groups.

Wolves are fiercely **loyal** to their pack, they are the ultimate team players. ... Understand your place, follow the rules and be loyal to your 'pack'. Wolves will do anything to protect their family, even if it means sacrificing themselves
