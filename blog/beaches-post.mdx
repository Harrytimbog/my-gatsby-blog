What makes a great beach all depends on the traveler. Some prefer wide stretches of sand with ample activities and throngs of people to watch, while others desire deserted shorelines with calm waters.
Some of my **favorite** beaches are:

* Agadir Beach (Morocco)
* JBR Open Beach (Dubai)
* Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)
* Ipanema (Rio de Janeiro)
* Jo√£o Fernandes (Buzios)
